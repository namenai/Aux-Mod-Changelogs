As the name suggests the main focus of this update was improving the gameplay in the skies, Star Wars dogfights took *obvious* inspiration from the white knuckle engagements of WWII, and with that in mind I have made various additions and changes in an attempt to capture the *ascetic* and *excitement* of space (Air) battles in the star wars universe. Here are the changes specific to that goal ü•î

Now the best changes for Aerium for last.
- ### Aviation Based
    + #### Functionality Additons
        + Targeting Computers üéØ
            + All combat aircraft now come equipped with an AI turret which greatly improves the effectiveness of laser weapons. These turrets are for AI use only, are limited in their rotation and zeus is able to delete the turret. There is also a new function mentioned above for players to do the same.
        + Missiles
            + A new range of missiles for all aircraft, balanced around vanilla values
        + Bombs
            + A host of ordinance with various features, balanced around vanilla values
        + Cannons
            + All aircraft in addition to the turret recieved an upgrade to their main guns, this is to make up for the lack of a turret on player controlled aircraft. The AI will use these guns in rare circumstances and with CAS modules, so watch out!
        + Bloodlust
            + All aircraft are now capable, and very willing, to engage infantry targets.
        + Damage Check
            + Hull integraty check added to all aircraft    
    + #### Aviation Items Removed
        + Missiles
            + Like, all of them, get good
        + Bombs
            + Yeeted them too. üí£
        + "Repulsor Full Stop" that stops by killing you üíÄ
            + Who even came up with this in the first place? 
    + #### Aviation Changes
        + All aircraft
            + Stability
                + All non clone wars era aircraft have had their mass adjusted to perform more reliably at speed.
            + Performance (~~RIP Airborne~~)(JK rolling)(`Zatama was smoking too many potatoes`)
                + ~~Aircraft are no longer capable of exceeding the maximum altitude of the zeus camera.   
                    +This is a **highly experimental** change, feedback is ***extremely*** important.Maximum thrust is at 1.7km and loses all thrust at 2km. The little bird flies higher~~
            + Loadout
                + All aircraft have had their weapon loadouts altered drastically
        + Delta 7A
            + Model changed to Delta 7B to fix mesh issues
        + Armor Templates
            + Armor has been normalised across all airframes
                +   Interceptor Class - 100 Armor üõ°Ô∏è
                +   Fighter Class - 200 Armor üõ°Ô∏è
                +   Bomber Class - 300 Armor üõ°Ô∏è
                +   Transport + Hero Class(Mordhau grip mode ‚öîÔ∏è) - 600 Armor üõ°Ô∏è
                +   **Armor is increased by 100 if the aircraft carries a shield generator in lore,however there are exceptions**
                +   BTW its Armor *NOT* Armour you weirdos üëå
        + CX-P Zatama ü•î
            + Now capable of enjoying the game  
        + CX-D Namenai üê≤

*This is where the fun begins* üòÄ  
## Prototype
These are the prototype changes. Basicly they are changes that we the real mod boiz are playing around with. They are not ment to be used on any full scale offical capacity but rather to get peoples thoughts and feelings and get input on the changes. Now the reason for these changes is to expand the room in which each weapon can vary from each other. Right now its very difficult to make any weapon diffrent from one another due to the range of parameters availible. So the prototypes are ment to expand that range to give each gun a diffrent flavor. These are ofcourse ment for testing and may or may not be balanced. ü§£

The 2 main focus are the `DC-15A` and `DC-15S` revolving mainly around the rate of fire, recoil and damage. The other weapons are there just to give a feeling as to what I have in mind. 

There is a naming scheme to this. For example we have
```
(PROTOTYPE Class N) DC-15A
```
or
```
(PROTO Class N) DC-15A Long Engagment
```
`PROTO` cause the name gets too long.

This means that this is a prototype of the DC-15A made by namenai, N for namenai, holy shit, so if theres any issues/suggestions/toughts you would go talk to namenai directly. Class Z is for Zatama and Class R is for Rexi (RIP ‚ö∞Ô∏è). Ez PP ezy dont get it twisted now.
- ### Infantry Based Prototype
    - #### Prototype Class N DC-15A
        - Semi auto only, shoots every 0.6 seconds which means rate of fire is 100 rounds per minute
        - Hella kick, based of recoils from shotguns in UNSUNG but tuned up, blame flog ü§£
        - As such the damage of the one and only mag that it can use is way more then even the currnet LE's damage. 30 round mag aswell. 
        - x4 scope with the scope picture thing is the same as the LE's becuase the old one, while looking nice cause of its white accents, was shit cause the red dot was like 4 times bigger then a droid at close range.
        - Oh also has 100% accuracy, 0 dispersion, so if you miss its your fault.
    - #### Prototype Class N DC-15A Long Engagment
        - Same as Proto Class N DC-15A
        - Accepts same mags as Proto Class N DC-15A
        - Muzzle velocity is twice of Proto Class N DC-15A
        - instead has scope that has x4,x8,x12, night vision and **thermals**
        - NOTE: the scope is misaligned,but so is the normal LE. So why is that you notice it here more? Because this gun has 100% accuracy so it always goes to the same spot where as the normal LE has some dispersion, so what I am basicly saying is if you cant hit with this proto weapon, then yyou have been relying on RNG to hit your shots XD. 
    - #### Prototype Class N DC-15A Mod 0
        - 500 rounds per minute,full auto only
        - Accepts same mags as Proto Class N DC-15A,plus has its own mag thats 100 rounds but lower damage, around the currnet medium rounds.
        - Muzzle velocity is lower,by about 40%, of Proto Class N DC-15A
        - Recoil is modified,taken from the FN Minimi SPW thats in vanilla arma 3 but with a little bit more recoil.
        - Will have same scope,but only x4 and no x1.
    - #### Prototype Class N DC-15S
        - Literally 1000 rounds per minute
        - thats it
        - No really thats it.
    
- ### Vehicle Based Prototype
    - #### Prototype Class N AV-19
        - Simply put its an AV-7 with the vinilla arma 3 arty weapons and ammo.

*What are frames* üéûÔ∏è
## Particle Effects

The most I will say is, go throw an explosive and see that refraction effect. Most explosives should have it. They where made by a CUP dev named [Taro](https://forums.bohemia.net/forums/topic/221306-refraction-blast-wave/) who I asked for permission to use and modify, so please credit it to him. Click his name to go to the BI forum about this.

Obviously the particle effects do need tuning, so i'll do that.
