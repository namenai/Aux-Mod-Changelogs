# Hey look I hab idea.

> plz look thx - *me*

# The Motive

Okay so that DC-15s carbine is hella useless, the markmen rifle is too weak, and im remaking the mod. So why dont I rework the mod and fix these weirdness.

Everything that ima about to say revolves around the carbine and the rifle. So remember that.

# The Mags

Each weapon will have atleast 2 kinds of mags. 1 mag that will be unique/special to it, like how the z6 has a 200 round or watever mag and the westar has a 100 round mag. The other mag will be a standard mag that any clone weapon can use like how in RHS the m249 can use the 30 round mag of any M4. This is all excluding sutff like the GL's grenade mags, and stun mags cause the stun mag real.

Heres what I am thinking for the standard mag: 30 rounds, low weight so you can carry alot, damage will be around that of DC-15a low rounds, and slowish muzzle velocity. What im also thinking is that perhaps make it so that this round doesnt have bullet drop, but all the other specialty ammo of the specialty mags have bullet drop. 

# The Scopes

Im going to make the scopes use 1 of 2 scopes, the blue crosshair one from the LE, or the red dot crosshair one from the old old valken. This is because well, there isnt that mayn scopes in swop that are not fully shit.

# The Gunz

Each gun has been changed inorder to give it a distinct role and actual purpose.

## DC-15a

* Semi auto only, paired with a lower rate of fire, perhaps shooting every `0.3` or `0.2` seconds.
* Higher recoil.
* Hella accurate, like even more so then now if thats even possible
* The mags for this rilfe will be the standard mag, and 20 or 40 round DC-15a mag that shoots the current high mag rounds.
* x4 scope instead of x3, cause M4 has x4.

## DC-15 GL

* Same as rifle
* I belive the 212th have a DC-15GL model,but im not sure about changing it cause theres no model for DC-15a or DC-15 mod 0 then, since the 212th DC-15a model will go to LE.

## DC-15 LE

* Same as rifle,but will have a x4-12 scope
* Im thinking a special mag, perhaps 5 rounds. Maybe AP, HE, or APHE. I am open to ideas, this isnt something im 100% attached to, just thought it be a cool idea.
* However it will do more damage when shooting the same ammo as the rifle becuase the LE will fire them at a higher velocity, which will cause more damage.
* Perhaps uses the 212th DC-15 model since all swop DC-15 models have a slight off center of the scope, and marksmen needs the accuracy.

## DC-15 Mod 0

* Full auto only.
* Low recoil.
* Access to the standard mag, plus a 100-200 round low damage mag
* Same x4,but without that alternate iron sight holograph cause swop is big dumb, so it will be a x1-x4 variable scope.
* Worse accuracy then the above 3.
* Belt feed by ace too. ( if it cant already)

## DC-15s carbine

* Sexy as fuck rate of fire, something high
* Low recoil
* standard mag, plus a 60-80 round low damage mag.
* Switch to 212th model cause lets be real its nice.

## Z6

* Im not sure if I should touch recoil
* not sure if theres anything need donig for z6 actualy
* Change to 212th model.

## Westar rifle, and GL

* Reduce recoil
* Semi and full auto.
* damage inbetween carbine and rifle

## DC-17

* To keep it simple, m1911 OwO.

~~## DC-17a~~

~~* Literaly same model as DC-17, but I will make it into a UZI type weapon? Or is it Glock 22 that goes full auto? idk as Scuba he uses Glocks.~~ (seems to be not liked.)

## Shotgun

* HAHAHAHA ima w8 till Contact DLC.

## DC-15x

* High recoil.
* Low rate of fire,very low
* 6 round HEAT mag, yes ik, but it makes sense (HEAT ammo in the sense of arma so dont worry).

# The End

Im open to debate to all of this btw, this isnt a one way street (well it sorta is but by my Goodness,Greatness and Grace I shall allow it)
