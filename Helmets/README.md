## People who make the helmets

**CS Sam:** Will be the lead for texturing for the mod. If you have questions ask him.  
**CT Calo:** Will be in charge of Airborne related textures.  
**CX-X Casskun:** Will be incharge of Aviation related textures, helmets ,vehicles and whatever.  
**CP Kestral:** Will be in charge of Infantry textures and other miscellaneous textures.  

All other textures will be spread across these 4.

These folks will get in contact with you, depending on where you are, regarding your helmet.

## Process

### Helmet apporval process for Airborne, Aviation and Infantry

1. Design your helmet with the base template. 
2. Once your done, submit the texture to the forum [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRKswPFHkU03VbGv9LXHPPz_WpMMbagMCvZkUCRBz3xkbcJg/viewform)
3. If your helmet is rejected by the texturer then apply changes said texturer said/suggests.
4. Once the texturer has accepted the helmet and meets the guidelines, the template will be sent to youe direct CoC for acceptance. If CoC denies then remake helmet with their specifications
5. Texturer will then texture the helmet and finally show an ingame preview of the helmet to both you and your direct CoC for acceptance.
6. After this final acceptance the helmet will be put in queue to be put in mod.
7. enjoy ðŸ˜Š.


### ARC

Follow the same as infantry, but instead of using the templates for veteran/CS the arc member would use their squad helmet as a template. For example if in Adenn squad,the person would use the Adenn helmet as their template and apply the markings based of their rank.

## Templates

**Disregard** the uniform, only look at helmet.
